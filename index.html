    <p>The iconic Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in the mid 80s in Southern California. Long time friends Anthony Kiedis<em>(vocals)</em>and Flea<em>(bass)</em>got <br>
        together and began to coloaborate. Their first 3 albums helped redefine the funk genre.  However, it wasnt until their fourth studio
        album that they would become a success.  Mother's Milk gave the band the recognition they needed to become great. Their following
        album Blood Sugar Sex Magik would help solidify them as one of the greatest bands ever, selling over 13 million copies world wide
        and going platinum.  With great success comes drama, and as a result Guitarist John Frusciante would quit the band .  Record sales
        would take a hit during his absence, but a few years later he would rejoin the band and go on to help create Californication, By the Way,
        and Stadium Arcadium which were all successful.  To this day the Red Hot Chili Peppers remain one of the grestest bandsof all time!!!
